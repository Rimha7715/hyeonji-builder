# Blueprint: Asset Growth Comparison Website

## Overview

This project is a web application that visualizes and compares the 10-year growth of Bitcoin, Gold, and the Stock Market (S&P 500). The goal is to provide a clear, visually engaging comparison of these three major asset classes.

## Project Outline

### Design and Style

*   **Layout:** A clean, modern, single-page layout.
*   **Color Scheme:** A dark theme with vibrant colors for the chart data, defined using CSS variables.
*   **Typography:** 'Poppins' from Google Fonts for a clean, modern look with a clear visual hierarchy.
*   **Visuals:** A primary line chart with a "lifted" card appearance and subtle background texture.
*   **Interactivity:** The chart has tooltips, and key elements have hover effects.

### Features

*   **Asset Comparison:** The application will display a line chart comparing the growth of Bitcoin, Gold, and the S&P 500 over the last 10 years.
*   **Data Visualization:** The growth will be visualized on a line chart for easy comparison.
*   **Responsive Design:** The website will be fully responsive and accessible on mobile and desktop devices.

## Current Plan: Design Enhancement

I will now enhance the visual design of the application to create a more modern, premium, and engaging user experience.

1.  **Typography & Fonts:** Import the 'Poppins' font from Google Fonts to create a cleaner and more modern typographic style. Adjust font sizes and weights to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
2.  **Color Palette:** Introduce a refined color palette using CSS variables for easy management. The new palette will use a darker background and more vibrant, distinct colors for the chart lines (Bitcoin, Gold, S&P 500) to improve clarity.
3.  **Background Texture:** Add a subtle noise texture to the background to create a sense of depth and a premium, tactile feel.
4.  **Component Styling:** The chart container will be styled as a "lifted" card with a multi-layered `box-shadow` to create a strong sense of depth.
5.  **Code Refactoring:** The stylesheet and Chart.js configuration will be updated to use the new design system.
